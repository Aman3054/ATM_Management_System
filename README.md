# ATM_Management_System
Overview
This project simulates a basic ATM system using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows users to perform basic banking operations such as setting a PIN, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and checking their account balance.

Features
Set a PIN for the account
Withdraw cash from the account
Deposit money into the account
Check the current account balance
Exit the system
Technical Details
The project uses C++ as the programming language
The system is designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
The ATM class encapsulates the data and behavior of the ATM system
The main function provides a simple text-based interface for users to interact with the system
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine
Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g. g++)
Run the executable file to start the ATM simulation
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform banking operations
